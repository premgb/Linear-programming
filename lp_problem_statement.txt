Linear Programming - Problem Statement 
######

The U-save company is planning its operations for the next year.  The company is considering investing in four types of securities.  The company has $1 million available for investment. The expected annual return and the “risk index” of each security are as follows:

Bonds			Expected return 	Risk index (%)
Long-term Bonds 	15% 			3
Medium-term Bonds 	12% 			4
Government Bonds 	9% 			7
Short-term Bonds 	10% 			9

The company wants to maximize the expected return from its bond investments, subject to the following restrictions:
1.	The average risk index of the portfolio should not exceed 6
2.	At most 45% of the total amount invested can be invested in any single bond
3.	The expected return of the Government bond portfolio should be at least 1.2 times the return of the Long term and medium term bond portfolio.

Formulate the problem as a LP problem. Define the decision variables carefully and obtain an optimal solution.

Proposed Solution:
######

Decision Variables:
X1 - Amount of money spent in Long-term bonds
X2 - Amount of money spent in Medium-term bonds
X3 - Amount of money spent in Government bonds
X4 - Amount of money spent in Short-term bonds

Objective function:
Maximize Z = 15 X1 + 12 X2 + 9 X3 + 10 X4

Constraints:
1.	Average risk index
a.	(3 X1 + 4 X2 + 7 X3 + 9 X4) /4 <= 6 
2.	Amount invested in any single bond
a.	X1 <= 0.45 
b.	X2 <= 0.45 
c.	X3 <= 0.45 
d.	X4 <= 0.45 
3.	Expected return of the Government bond portfolio
a.	9 X3 >= 1.2 (15 X1 + 12 X2)
4.	Cash available for investment 
a.	X1+X2+X3+X4 = 1 
5.	Non-negativity constraints
a.	X1, X2, X3, X4 >= 0
